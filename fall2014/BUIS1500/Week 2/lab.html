		<p>
			This is a paragraph of text.  There are many like it, but this one
			is mine.

			Linux is an amazing operating system, I prefer to use it for development
			because it's open source, and centralized repositories are the way 
			to go when it comes to installing software, rather than have
			to Google for installers, and hope to God that your version of Windows
			likes whatever software you're attempting to install.  Now that I'm
			getting used to Linux terminal environments, I also prefer to use
			it for server administration, and I've done some of that for a 
			couple gaming communities I've been a part of.
		</p>
		<p>
			My current distribution of choice is Linxu Mint 17, but I have also
			used Ubuntu (destop/server), Fedora, Gentoo, and Debian.
