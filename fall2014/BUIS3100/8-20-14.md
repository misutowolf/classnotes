When it comes to information, what's meaningful is entirely dependent on who will be looking at it.

A data model contains:
* Abstract types/concepts
* Relationships and interactions between types
* Provides a concise way to communicate these types/relationships

When determining types, look for similarities between objects.

A model lets the client see what you're doing, and lets you understand what they are doing.

Data models have many uses:
* Provide a way to understand an existing system
* Understanding part (or all) of a business better
* Educating management, end user, computer folks!
