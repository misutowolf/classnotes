Financial accounting is governed by concepts and rules known as GAAP, or

* Relevant information - Affects decisions of its users

## Principles and Assumptions of Accounting
* Measurement Principle (cost principle) -- accounting is based on actual cost.
* Revenue Recognition Principle -- says when a company must recognize revenue (income).
* Matching Principle (expense recognition) -- record what it costs to generate revenue
* Full Disclosure Principle -- requires a company to report the details behind financial statements that would impact users' decisions.
* Going-Concern Assumption -- means that accounting info reflects a presumption the business will stay open.
* Monetary unit assumption -- means we can express transactions in terms of money.
* Time Period Assumption -- presumes that the life of a company can be divided into time periods, such as months/years.
* Business Entity Assumption -- means that a business is accounted for separately from its owner or other business entities.

## Business Entity Forms
* Sole Proprietorship -- One person in business (unlim. liability)
* Partnership -- 2+ people in an agreement (unlim. liability)
* Corporation -- Limited liability, you can't lose more than you invest.  Separated from PERSONAL assets.

## Sarbanes-Oxley Act
In response to a number of public accounting scandals (Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, ImClone),
Congress passed SOX in 2002 to curb financial abuses in public companies.  Sets
stringent internal controls and financial/accounting oversight.  This produced 
increased transparency.

## ACCOUNTING EQUATION
*Assets = Liabilities + Equity*

## Assets
Resources owned by a company:
* Cash
* Vehicles
* Store Supplies
* Buildings
* Land
* Equipment
* Accounts Receivable (Money owed in less than 12 months)
* Notes Receivable (Similar to AR, but more than 12 months, more formal)

## Liabilities
Creditors' claim on assets.  Money owed.
* Accounts Payable
* Taxes Payable
* Notes Payable
* Wages Payable

## Equity 
Owner's claim on assets
* Contributed Capital
* Dividends
* Retained Earnings

## Expanded Accounting Equation
Contributed Capital - Dividends + Revenues - Expenses
(Dividends + Revenues - Expanses) = Retained Earnings!

Expenses are a decrease to EQUITY.

Parts of table:
* Assets: Cash/Supplies/Equipment
* Liabilities: Accounts Payable/Notes Payable
* Equity: Common Stock/Dividends/Revenue/Expenses

## Financial Statements
* Income Statement
* Statement of Retained Earnings
* Balance Sheet
* Statement of Cash Flows

COMPANY NAME
