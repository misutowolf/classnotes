## Principles and Assumptions of Accounting
* Measurement Principle (cost principle) -- accounting is based on actual cost.
* Revenue Recognition Principle -- says when a company must recognize revenue (income).
* Matching Principle (expense recognition) -- record what it costs to generate revenue
* Full Disclosure Principle -- requires a company to report the details behind financial statements that would impact users' decisions.
* Going-Concern Assumption -- means that accounting info reflects a presumption the business will stay open.
* Monetary unit assumption -- means we can express transactions in terms of money.
* Time Period Assumption -- presumes that the life of a company can be divided into time periods, such as months/years.
* Business Entity Assumption -- means that a business is accounted for separately from its owner or other business entities.

## Business Entity Forms
* Sole Proprietorship -- One person in business (unlim. liability)
* Partnership -- 2+ people in an agreement (unlim. liability)
* Corporation -- Limited liability, you can't lose more than you invest.  Separated from PERSONAL assets.

## Sarbanes-Oxley Act
In response to a number of public accounting scandals (Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, ImClone),
Congress passed SOX in 2002 to curb financial abuses in public companies.  Sets
stringent internal controls and financial/accounting oversight.  This produced 
increased transparency.
